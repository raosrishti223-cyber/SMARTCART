# SMARTCART
SMARTCART is an intelligent e-commerce cart system built using advanced data structures. It lets users browse products, manage a cart, and receive smart recommendations. A BST stores the catalog, while linked lists and queues handle cart and history. The system also predicts user preferences for a personalized shopping experience.
